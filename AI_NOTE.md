# 🤖 AI Notes

This project was developed using AI tools responsibly and with full understanding of the implementation.

---

## 🧠 Where AI Was Used

AI was used for:

- Initial architecture brainstorming
- SQL query structuring
- Debugging edge cases
- OpenAI response formatting refinement

All AI suggestions were reviewed and manually tested before implementation.

---

## 🔍 What I Verified Myself

- Database schema correctness
- API route correctness
- TypeScript type safety
- State management logic
- Server vs Client component separation
- Handling inconsistent AI JSON formats

---

## 🤖 LLM Used in Application

- **Model:** gpt-4o-mini
- **Provider:** OpenAI

### Why this model?

- Cost efficient
- Fast response time
- Reliable structured JSON output
- Good extraction quality for short meeting transcripts

The model is instructed with strict JSON schema output to ensure consistent structure.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables
- `.env` excluded from version control
- No secrets hard-coded
- Input validation before AI call

---

All implementation decisions were consciously reviewed and understood.
